-API: remove futures from categories


-home page calls 3 categories in 3 containers
-go back to creatList, create a list for each filter
-attention to spread copy state! new events should not get attached at the end but respect order of ids...


-toggle event needs to read global variable of openid, reset the open one if necessary, open the new one and set the global variable to new id or false.
-openEvent needs access to byId list, so should be a combined reducer from byId and openEvent
-maybe move toggle action into main event reducer that has access to both, eventopen and byId
